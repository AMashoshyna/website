title: New Website

I decided to rebuild my website today, from scratch.

I've been working in the sphere of high-complexity, company-internal JavaScript web apps for a few years now. I've really enjoyed that, but I'm in the mood to try something different.

With this website I'm going to seek minimalism. My goals are to:
- Get back to HTML. Semantic markup; no `<div>`-soup. Let's make View Source meaningful again.
- Not have any client-side JS or CSS that's absolutely required. HTML alone should provide a reasonable experience.
- Have as few dependencies as is reasonable - on both the client and server. Probably zero on the client; we'll see.
- Provide a lean and pleasant blogging experience for myself, with no database to configure and manage.
- Experiment with emerging web technologies, particularly around HTML and CSS. Try out some new HTML5 tags. Throw in a few bits of unusual delight, without bloating things down. See what the browser can do without being overridden by a JS framework.
